## Production Tor Hidden Service config file.
## See https://torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html for more details.

## Hidden service directory
## Should be attached to Docker volume for Docker setup.
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/hs_data

## Tor will redirect requests to this specified address and port.
## All requests received at the port 80 will be redirected to nginx:8080, Docker will resolve the hostname.
HiddenServicePort 80 nginx:8080

## Explicitly set this Tor instance to publish the hidden service.
## Setting this to 0 is only useful when using a separate Tor controller app or onionbalance.
PublishHidServDescriptors 1

## Explicitly set hidden service version to the most recent one, i.e. - 3.
HiddenServiceVersion 3

## Explicitly tell Tor to close connections with unrecognised ports.
## Mostly a mild inconvenience for port scanners.
HiddenServiceAllowUnknownPorts 0

## Number of simultaneous connections allowed per rendezvous circuit (i.e. per user), 0 - unlimited, by default.
## 100 is already way overkill for most services.
## Unlimited by default, which opens your node for easy DoS attack.
## Different values may be useful for DDoS protection.
## NOTE: May require tweaking.
HiddenServiceMaxStreams 100

## Setting this to 1 will tell Tor to torn down rendezvous circuit that exceeded HiddenServiceMaxStreams.
## 0 by default, which means that connection attempts exceeding HiddenServiceMaxStreams will be silently ignored.
## Setting this to 1 may be useful for DDoS protection, at the same time it may annoy your clients,
## if they are making more that HiddenServiceMaxStreams connections while legitimately using your service.
## NOTE: May require tweaking.
HiddenServiceMaxStreamsCloseCircuit 0

## Number of introduction points, 3 by default.
## 10 is maximum for v2 hidden service, 20 is maximum for v3 hidden service.
## One of the ways to scale your hidden service,
## since popular once may overload their introduction points, if there aren't enough of them.
## NOTE: When using OnionBalance - Vanguards developer advices against using too many of these,
## since it will make it possible to determine that the service is in fact using OnionBalance.
## On the other hand - this may not matter at all, since any decently running hidden services
## surely uses Onionbalance.
## See for advices: https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards/blob/master/README_SECURITY.md
## NOTE: May require tweaking.
HiddenServiceNumIntroductionPoints 3

## Explicitly tell Tor not to use experimental non-anonymous direct connections.
## Even when set to 1 clients will still use anonymous circuits and be protected,
## server will be mostly unprotected, but faster for clients.
## WARNING: Setting to 1 will make you, as a hidden service operator, non-anonymous!
HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 0
HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 0



### Onionbalance-related directives ###

## Tell this Tor instance to behave as an Onionbalance backend node.
HiddenServiceOnionBalanceInstance 1

## NOTE: Tor will expect to find a file "ob_config" under HiddenServiceDir with a single line like this (and nothing else):
## MasterOnionAddress <frontend_onion_address>
## This line will tell Tor to accept connections intended for the hidden service with that address,
## which should be an actual front-end .onion address of this hidden service.
